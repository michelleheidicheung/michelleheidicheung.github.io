<p><span class="subhead">‚ÄúSloth Lover‚Äôs‚Äù Perfect Gift for all ages!</span><br>
<span class="greentext">This was a gift for my adult Sister who loves Sloths!
	She absolutely loved it ü•∞</span></p>

<p><span class="subhead">Not as cute as it seems</span><br>
<span class="bluetext">I've done 2 of these and both have turned out weird. It's takes more than 3 days and requires you to break down the stump to get the sloth out. 3 stars only because I adore sloths and after drying out he looked better.</span></p>

	<p><span class="subhead">Do not waste your money</span><br>
		<span class="greentext">waste of time and money. never hatched.</span></p>

<p><span class="subhead">Getting past that awkward phase...</span><br>
<span class="bluetext">I gave this to our four year old as a spring break project & it's super cute! After he added water initially, we shook and tapped the stump under the water until bubbles stopped popping out. After a couple of days we poked at the stump and probably made him come out sooner than he should - he was a little lumpy and weird looking in some places... I imagine this is why he is supposed to be hidden in the stump until he is big enough to emerge on his own. After a few days he grew into the lumps and is adorable. Be patient and withhold judgement... It has been nine days since we started this project.</span></p>

	<p><span class="subhead">Meh</span><br>
<span class="greentext">Not as exciting as I‚Äôd hoped it to be. Looked like a raccoon more than a sloth - except there was no raccoon tail</span></p>
